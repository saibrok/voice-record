### Language

- All communication in chat — Russian.
- Code comments — Russian.
- Console logs, warnings and errors — Russian.
- Documentation files (README, AGENTS, architecture docs) — Russian.
- Identifiers (variables, classes, methods) — English.

### Tests

- Unit tests are NOT required for the current milestone (MVP-0 / MVP-1).
- Tests may be introduced later for stable, pure logic (e.g. data tables, math utilities).
- Do not add test frameworks unless explicitly requested.

### Code documentation

- Use JSDoc/TSDoc selectively.
- Document:
  - public APIs (Engine2D, GameAPI, GameState);
  - scene lifecycle contracts;
  - non-obvious algorithms (game loop, ECS internals).
- Avoid documenting trivial or self-explanatory code.
